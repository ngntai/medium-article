    <h1>How code could finally disrupt the renewable energy world</h1>
    <h2>Let's take a deep dive into it...</h2>

    <h2 class="title">Why renewable energy matters</h2>
    <p>Using clean, renewable energy is one of the most important actions you can take to reduce your impact on the environment. Electricity production is our #1 source of greenhouse gases, more than all of our driving and flying combined, and clean energy also reduces harmful smog, toxic buildups in our air and water, and the impacts caused by coal mining and gas extraction. This is a global problem, and also a local environmental justice issue—air and water pollution from fossil use and extraction disproportionally affects local disadvantaged communities located near those facilities.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Why coding matters</h2>
    <p>If you’ve never learned to code, to program a computer to do something, I recommend you give it a try. While I wouldn’t describe myself as a professional coder by any stretch, I know how to automate tasks I normally perform manually, scrape web pages for information, and program the machine to do other interesting, helpful things. The act of programming is a liberating feeling and everyone should try it at least once or twice.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Why putting them together is a no-brainer</h2>
    <p>Soaring energy consumption by ever more powerful computers, data centers and mobile devices has many experts looking to reduce the energy use of these devices. Most projects so far focus on more efficient cooling systems or energy-saving power modes.

      A University of Washington project sees a role for programmers to reduce the energy appetite of the ones and zeroes in the code itself. Researchers have created a system, called EnerJ, that reduces energy consumption in simulations by up to 50 percent, and has the potential to cut energy by as much as 90 percent. They will present   the research next week in San Jose at the Programming Language Design and Implementation annual meeting.</p>
